											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Maryland, College Park. I was originially born in Boston, Massachusetts where I've lived in the state since. Since a young age, I've always been interested in technology, from toy robots all the way up to developing phone apps. I've found that coding is something creative that I enjoy, and I plan to practice my skill further and pursue a career in it.<br/><br/>

												<li>This course is relevant to me as a prospering Software Engineer and Computer Science major because I will more than likely face an ethical issue while in the workplace. When developing software, where bomb deployment tools would be a good example, there will be things you are asked to make that may have ethical implications to society as a whole or a smaller group of people, and this course will help guide me through those difficult thought processes I will need to undertake.<br/><br/>

												<li>Before entering this class, my perception of ethics was moreso along the lines of politial-correctness, and making sure that what you say is okay with everyone who may hear it. It was kind of just a jumble of what I've heard from around people. Now, I understand that ethics relates to making sure your actions are for the benefit of society.<br/><br/>

												<li>For this semester, I hope to learn as much as I can about what I should do if presented with certain situations that could yield unethical consequences. I want to learn what I should do in case I realize what I'm doing is unethical, so I can prevent any mishaps. This will be ensured be me doing the course work to the best of my ability and studying all the cases closely so I have more background knowledge. I'm confident if I do the work necessary for this course I will come out prepared for ethical issues in the workplace.

								<h3>Reactions from Resources</h3>
								<ul style="text-align: left">
									<li><i>The Ethical Engineer</i> - Robert McGinn<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">This book was very eye-opening. I think the cases in this book were extremely interesting, and the ideas presented via the analysis and discussions are great. Also, I like the stories the cases bring because they bring you closer to the ethical problems. There's a personal connection it creates with me as well because of how it explains that the cases could be engineering dilemmas you face in the real world too. McGinn does a fantastic job of analysis and creating a viewpoint into the case so that the user understands what went wrong and how to avoid it.</p></li>
									<li><i>Structural Integrity</i> - 99% Invisible<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">The 99% Invisible podcast about the Citicorp building was interesitng especially in comparison to <i>The Ethical Engineer</i>'s record of the case. My opinion of this podcast was that it was more focused on entertaining the listener (which is understandable) than educating the audience, which the book did better (this is also understandable, as a podcast has to grab the attention a little harder). I think it was a good source of overall information, besides its gender-specific focus for a bit.</p></li>
									<li><i>Five Freedoms for the Homo Deus</i> - IEEE Security & Privacy<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">I thought this document formed very good guidelines for the future of artificial intelligence and upcoming technology. One of the most important pieces I believe came from this article was the idea of Freedom to Understand the Logic of the Machine, because the power of open-source software and hardware could be what saves us from a global takeover. With design plans, schematics, and code open to the public, we can make sure that the tools developed around us are for the better good of society, and the <i>Five Freedoms of Homo Deus</i> nails this.</p></li>
									<li><i>Ethics, Technology, and Engineering</i> - Ibo Van de Poel & Lamb√®r Royakkers<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">We read section 1.6 of this book, which went into depths about how engineers are not the only ones responsible for consequences of a technology they developed. I liked how they assigned groups of people to vocabulary that made it easier to sort out an ethical issue. It defined actors, users, regulators, and stakeholders. It made the general overview of an ethical dilemma more navigatable, and I thought that specific section was valuable to understand.</p></li>
									<li><i>Design Capabilities</i> - Carissa Carter<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">Althought this article seemed to relate less to ethical issues than the other assigned readings, it still indirectly held value in the content we've been studying. I enjoyed the interpretation of the old "five hexagon" design strategies into the new Eight Capabilities they described. It was both interesting and a nice diverge from normal content.</p></li>
									<li><i>Best Laid Plans</i> - William A. Shermen<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">This novel by Shermen detailed how the unintended consequences from the human race have always been more dangerous and impactful than they ever thought possible by their creation. It also expands into how to avoid these massive ethical consequences, which is a vital part of information for this couse. We will more than likely face an ethical issue in our time in the workforce, so the more information we have on preventing or solving these issues the better.</p></li>
									<li><i>Why Do We Care So Much About Privacy?</i> - Louis Menand<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In one section this article spoke about the Cambridge Analytics issue with Facebook, with is definitely an ethical dilemma I think deserves a reaction. While first reading it my reaction was that it was very informative and also a modern text at the same time, bringing up very recent issues that most of us have probably heard about. It was a well-worded article that I think helped connect the old ethics cases to us students.</p></li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Messages from Class Meetings</h3>
								<ul style="text-align: left">
									<li><i>Lecture 1</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">The message from the very first ENEE200 class was that digital devices can actually propose a problem in the classroom when it comes to distracting you while taking notes and also distracting those in your vicinity. It made me think about my use in other classes, and if I should really be using it as much in my other classes because I would love to pass my first semester. This idea came up a few other times throughout the year, when I caught myself using my laptop or phone in ENEE200 and questioned whether I should really be doing so and how it is (not?) helping me in class. The connection between imagination, conversation, and application was also described in class, and we explored what that meant in terms of engineering ethics. In addition, I described to my partner about my challenge getting my large famaily of 7 down to UMD for my move in day, and it was funny and comforting to hear other people's stories.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 2</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">One of the things that really stuck with my from this lesson was just how controversial some ethical dilemmas could be, specifically in our discussion of the case of Cody Wilson. He developed a 3D-printable gun, and it made me think intensely about where the line for what is ethical in technology and what is not is drawn. It made me reflect on how I should double think when programming, and making sure everything I'm implementing is politically and ethically correct. His idea of a 3D-printable gun did in fact impose his freedom of speech, but it was questionably ethical in a larger scope of where people could freely print a gun if they wanted to kill someone. We talked about in class how this new technology modified existing standards of behavior and involved a brand new court ruling to determine if what Cody Wilson did was lawfully okay or not.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 3</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">During this lecture we dove into the ethics of everyday objects, which was definitely a new perspective I had never used before. We explored how potentially normal objects in our life now (like my group's assignment was a refridgerator), could potentially have brought along or insighted ethical issues when it was develop. This made me think about other things in my daily life, like sinks and disposable water bottles that impact the environment to a whole new level. I thought it was interesting in this lecture to discuss the FEREs and how they could be applicable in the development of these new technologies because we had just newly learned them and using the new material was helpful and increased my understanding.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 4</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In this lecture, we discussed what Codes of Conduct are and how they can be beneficial to a workplace. This was an interesting concept to me because it's almost like a set of moral rules to follow, and I think it does the job well for trying to minimize ethical dilemmas. I think they should be implemented anywhere necessary. We also discussed a few of the social factors that McGinn said has changed engineering: a change from people being more often employed at their own small firms to larger firms, the rise of the managerial engineer, increased complexity of engineer jobs, and the rising capital in the engineering field. I thought this was interesting to explore with a modern perspective as Apple just reached a trillion dollars in valuation, and it's becoming apparent that technology is going to be an absolutely massive part of our future.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 5</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">Here was where the socialtechnical map was shown to us, and we practiced how to implement and draw them. We revisted the ideas of what corresponds to a "Good Engineer" and also delved into the micro-, meso-, and macrosocial elements of a sociotechnical system. This taught me how to break apart a company into the different parts that work and more importantly made me think about the idea of a business as a whole. I began breaking the software company I interned at over the summer down into a mental sociotechnical map. In addition, we studied a quote in depth: "We [scientists] give you powerful engines; you [society] steer the ship." Our class explored how these powerful engines could have ethical issues and how society could not have the right mindset when steering a ship, and the discussion was very good surrounding this quote.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 6</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">Intended and unintended consequences, along with their similarities and differences, were discussed in Lecture 6. Something that really surprised me was the fact that female drivers are 47% more likely to be injured in a crash because the safety systems are specifically designed with a man's body in mind. This then can be applied to all engineered products, where you must consider every single user and use case that may be employed. The ideas employed here in class actually came up much later, around a month in the future when we were crafting ideas in my business class. We were developing a product idea, a disposable lint roller of some kind, and we wanted to market it as a unisex product. In engineering its design, we considered all genders and use cases of the lint roller in order to create a truly generic product that can be used be everyone.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 7</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In Lecture 7, we had a guest lecture from Dr. David Tomblin, the director of STS. He made us reflect on the hopes and concerns of the development of autonomous vehicles, which caused me to think about all the upcoming self-driving technology and whether it would be a burden or benefit. Self-driving cars would require loads of new infracture to be built, and this could instead be put to helping the hungry or poor instead. I find the geoengineering methods of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequestering it into the ground or somewhere safe to be fascinating. We could possibly do many things as a society, from simply planting more trees all the way to removing the carbon directly from the air with some complicated scientific process. I've been reading some news articles about scientific progress in that area because I'm in the Environment, Technology, and Economy Scholars program.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 8</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In this class, we went through possible solutions to prevent big unintended consequences, and we thought that treaties like the Geneva Convention could aid well. The section we learned on preventing disturbed equilibrium made me realize that you really do have to take into account every thing that could possibly go wrong in order to make a conscious ethical decision about the product. There are many "social mechanisms" that can help us decode these unintended consequences: careless design, organized complexity, chain reactions, reinforcing feedback, balancing forces, lock-in, adaptation, emergence, and disturbed equilibria. I think the idea of a CTA being used by a company is a good tool as well, and somethign I hope we use in the future.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 9</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">Here we discussed what culture is defined as and how it helps us identify ethics. The idea of stories were introduced, where we delved into who's stories were a part of and how to interpret these stories we're a part of. Culture means many different things, and is made up of a combination of education, age, religion, disability, political party, first language, SES/class, LGBTQ+ status, ethnicity and nationality. In regards to engineering and thinking about culture in an alternative manner, one could say that western engineering itself is a culture. Western engineering is then given to "less-developed" countries through "tech transfers" as described by McGinn in his book. The Bhopal accident in India where the US' technology developing MIC gas was transfered to Bhopal and then was mishandled and led to the death of thousands of Indian citizens was an example of a "tech transfer" that went poorly in a new culture.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 10</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">The focus of this class was identity, status, and reputation. Identity, status, and reputation can influence the standards of behavior present in people, ethical design approaches, and dialogic engagements. One of the quotes that stuck with me from this lecture is the idea that culture is "people acting in concert to the same set of rules" (Howard Becker). Personally, I defined my own identity as a UMD student from Massachusetts, aged 18, who is studying Computer Science and loves to play basketball. Status would be my position or rank compared to others, like me being a student and having teachers above me. In addition, reputation would be an overall character judgement from other people. This information we learned in class connects well with our discussions of engineering ethics, as companies have their own cultures for employees that influence their behavior.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 11</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In this class, we went in a different direction and learned about gender diversity in engineering and the cultures that effect it. We did an awesome activity in this class where we wrote down stereotypes that we think are attached to ourselves on a paper airplane and then throw that airplane to the other side of the room. It created lots of mutual understanding and was really just a great social experiment that I felt left an impact on the class. We all realized/became more aware of the stereotypes we are presented with and present. Then, we explored how a lack of diversity, especially in gender, can cause harms in the workplace. Teams without diversity overlook people, creating both physical and non-physical, and prevent bright minds from thriving, while diverse teams are shown by research to perform better.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 12</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In this class, we thought more critcally about the harms from a lack of diversity, and what we could do to avoid/remedy such harms. There was a lot of data presented to us about how both ethnically, racially, and gender diverse groups perform better than those without diversity. Then, we went into all the places that diversity impacts of is reflected in: engineering education, labor practices, design, and policy. There was also discussion of the wage gap, in both a race and gender sense. We learned how there is a 4-8% wage gap between men and females for no reason, and that wages for women even go down 7.5% after having their first child, which I fould to be very appalling. Even when comparing the average annual earnings of white and black men, the median white man makes almost double that of the median black man. That's a horrifically large gap, and one that needs discussion. In addition, there was a very interesting debate in this lecture where people recounted stories of Siri and Alexa not being able to understand their accents, which revealed more bias in engineering.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 13</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">Technomoral values in Big Data, AI, and social media was discussed in Lecture 13. Virtue ethics was revisited and how it could create better approaches to survellience, social media, and robots. A few stories were inspected, notably one about how residents of Uniontown, Alabama were upset that big polluters were coming to their small town, and they suspected that they were doing so because they were "black, poor, and educated." Something that stuck with me from this lecture and has came back through my head a few times the past weeks was the story of Professor Yang's friend who was invited to talk at a conference but then realized there was no women on the schedule of people presenting and declined to give his own speech. I think that was a very powerful move and one that does a great job of signaling to people the potential harms of not having gender diversity.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 14</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In Lecture 14, we delved into the normalization of deviance and organizational culture in the Challenger space explorer explosion. We used a sociotechnical perspective to inspect what caused the Challenger failure. Something interesting from this lecture specifically was the idea that technology drives history and in turn moves society. All the major events in history include or are results from technological progressions or changes. We created a sociotechnical map of the macro-, meso-, and microsocial views of NASA and the Challenger operation and looked for holes where issues may have risen. The Challenger expedition was part of a new NASA "story" where space missions were becoming extremely commercialized and citizens were beginning to be flown into space. McGinn suggested in his book that the Challenger explosion was a product of three issues: politicization and economization of decision-making, push-back from management, and normalization of risk.</p></li>

									<h2>Relevance to Myself</h2>
									<p>"Between 1997 and 2001, the author conducted an informal survey of Stanford undergraduate engineering students and the practicing engineers they contacted about two topics: the study of engineering-related ethical issues in undergraduate engineering education, and the presence of ethical issuues in engineering practice."</p>

								Over the period of time I've taken this course, I have definitely grown as an engineer and student. In regards to myself, I've learned that ethical issues are very important to me and I enjoy diving into them and learning more about what went wrong. With these cases and articles we've read, my perspective on the development of a project has changed. I learned that when creating something you need to be extra careful about who will use this and how they will use it, because you always want your product to be used in an ethically moral way. I could apply what we've learned in so many ways, especially in my development of iOS apps in my free time as a Computer Science major. When making apps, you always want to make sure they are accessible to everyone, regardless of handicap, and now I will also prevent any misuse of the apps I create.</p>

											<h2>Filter Bubble</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>My filter bubble most likely consists of a very liberal political outlook. I grew up in eastern Massachusetts where the liberal and progressive political parties are very strong, so naturally I up-took that perspective and eventually saw it as my own. On Twitter, I have never liked one of the President‚Äôs tweets, so they basically never show up on my timeline. Instead, lots of tweets about people rising up against Kavanaugh and fighting the President‚Äôs ideologies end up presenting themselves in my feed, and I understand the filter bubble shown there.<br/><br/>
												<li>How I attempted to break my filter bubble:
													<ol>
														<li>I used DuckDuckGo for the last week. Google has years of internet history on my account that pinpoints what I commonly search for and buy that makes it extremely hard to break out of the filter bubble it develops. Even the ads it gives me are extremely targeted to what I like. DuckDuckGo is a company that provides another search engine solution opposing Google that ensures the privacy of all your data, and tracks no information about you. With this, I was able to rid my internet searches of any potential bias from a filter bubble. When I searched up daily news, like I usually do in the morning, I was returned a plethora of scources from all ranges of the political spectrum. This allowed me to broaden my political scope and I made sure this week to click on the news sources that came up in the order in which they were returned, not by which ones I knew.</li>
														<li>In a similar function to broaden my political scope, I listened to the latest 5 podcasts of The Ben Shapiro Show on his website over the course of the last week. Ben Shapiro is an American conservative politicial commentator and writer, so his show was very different from the view my filter bubble presents to me. The topics ranged from "radical feminists" to Elizabeth Warren, to the recent Saudi journalist murder, so I feel as though I recieved a good overview of the idea of Shapiro's show.</li>
													</ol>
													<li>Challenges and surprises from trying to break my filter bubble:
														<ul>
															<li>DuckDuckGo is not nearly intuitive and helpful as Google is with the exact information I want to see from a search. If my query was more than a few words (like when I was doing my Computer Science project) I had to journey over to Google for a better answer.</li>
															<li>Some of the news sites that came up were more annoying to use than others, so I had to struggle through using the less-intuitive websites so I got a wide range of news.</li>
															<li>Sometimes more liberal articles returned because of the way I word my queries for news, but I did my best to remedy that and remove bias.</li>
															<li>Getting my news from different sources made me much more knowledgable about certain events because both parties use different statistics and facts to sway the reader, so I recieved more data overall.</li>
															<li>The Ben Shapiro Show was a bit difficult to listen to, simply because of the way he talks and how conservative his opinions were. I caught myself drifitng off and using my phone or even rolling my eyes.</li>
															<li>I was surprised however with how clearly he went through the news of that week, and I was impressed with the somewhat transparent persona he proposed.</li>
