											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Maryland, College Park. I was originially born in Boston, Massachusetts where I've lived in the state since. Since a young age, I've always been interested in technology, from toy robots all the way up to developing phone apps. I've found that coding is something creative that I enjoy, and I plan to practice my skill further and pursue a career in it.<br/><br/>

												<li>This course is relevant to me as a prospering Software Engineer and Computer Science major because I will more than likely face an ethical issue while in the workplace. When developing software, where bomb deployment tools would be a good example, there will be things you are asked to make that may have ethical implications to society as a whole or a smaller group of people, and this course will help guide me through those difficult thought processes I will need to undertake.<br/><br/>

												<li>Before entering this class, my perception of ethics was moreso along the lines of politial-correctness, and making sure that what you say is okay with everyone who may hear it. It was kind of just a jumble of what I've heard from around people. Now, I understand that ethics relates to making sure your actions are for the benefit of society.<br/><br/>

												<li>For this semester, I hope to learn as much as I can about what I should do if presented with certain situations that could yield unethical consequences. I want to learn what I should do in case I realize what I'm doing is unethical, so I can prevent any mishaps. This will be ensured be me doing the course work to the best of my ability and studying all the cases closely so I have more background knowledge. I'm confident if I do the work necessary for this course I will come out prepared for ethical issues in the workplace.

									In this section you will provide an archive of your reactions and struggles to each class session. Don't just describe what we did, but describe your feelings about what you did, and connect these feelings to other stories and events in your life. In each subsequent draft, you should continue to add your observations and to evolve this to reflect what you now understand (as opposed to what you did not previously understand). Include:<br/>

									<h2>My Personal Code</h2>
									<p>Over the course of the semester you will be given many different resources for thinking about ethical issues. Write a "code" that you can refer back to as you progress through your education and profession. The code should include important resources, including possibly other professional codes, and guidelines, a personal reflection on what issues you want to always be mindful of, and what habits/skills you can continue to develop in the service of just and caring design. If you can't figure all of this out to start with, just start writing, and you will figure it out through the process of writing. Remember, you will edit this throughout the semester, so be comfortable with the idea that it can change.
