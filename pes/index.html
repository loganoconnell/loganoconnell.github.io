											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Maryland, College Park. I was originially born in Boston, Massachusetts where I've lived in the state since. Since a young age, I've always been interested in technology, from toy robots all the way up to developing phone apps. I've found that coding is something creative that I enjoy, and I plan to practice my skill further and pursue a career in it.<br/><br/>

												<li>This course is relevant to me as a prospering Software Engineer and Computer Science major because I will more than likely face an ethical issue while in the workplace. When developing software, where bomb deployment tools would be a good example, there will be things you are asked to make that may have ethical implications to society as a whole or a smaller group of people, and this course will help guide me through those difficult thought processes I will need to undertake.<br/><br/>

												<li>Before entering this class, my perception of ethics was moreso along the lines of politial-correctness, and making sure that what you say is okay with everyone who may hear it. It was kind of just a jumble of what I've heard from around people. Now, I understand that ethics relates to making sure your actions are for the benefit of society.<br/><br/>

												<li>For this semester, I hope to learn as much as I can about what I should do if presented with certain situations that could yield unethical consequences. I want to learn what I should do in case I realize what I'm doing is unethical, so I can prevent any mishaps. This will be ensured be me doing the course work to the best of my ability and studying all the cases closely so I have more background knowledge. I'm confident if I do the work necessary for this course I will come out prepared for ethical issues in the workplace.

								<h3>Reactions from Resources</h3>
								<ul style="text-align: left">
									<li><i>The Ethical Engineer</i> - Robert McGinn<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">This book was very eye-opening. I think the cases in this book were extremely interesting, and the ideas presented via the analysis and discussions are great. Also, I like the stories the cases bring because they bring you closer to the ethical problems. There's a personal connection it creates with me as well because of how it explains that the cases could be engineering dilemmas you face in the real world too. McGinn does a fantastic job of analysis and creating a viewpoint into the case so that the user understands what went wrong and how to avoid it.</p></li>
									<li><i>Structural Integrity</i> - 99% Invisible<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">The 99% Invisible podcast about the Citicorp building was interesitng especially in comparison to <i>The Ethical Engineer</i>'s record of the case. My opinion of this podcast was that it was more focused on entertaining the listener (which is understandable) than educating the audience, which the book did better (this is also understandable, as a podcast has to grab the attention a little harder). I think it was a good source of overall information, besides its gender-specific focus for a bit.</p></li>
									<li><i>Five Freedoms for the Homo Deus</i> - IEEE Security & Privacy<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">I thought this document formed very good guidelines for the future of artificial intelligence and upcoming technology. One of the most important pieces I believe came from this article was the idea of Freedom to Understand the Logic of the Machine, because the power of open-source software and hardware could be what saves us from a global takeover. With design plans, schematics, and code open to the public, we can make sure that the tools developed around us are for the better good of society, and the <i>Five Freedoms of Homo Deus</i> nails this.</p></li>
									<li><i>Ethics, Technology, and Engineering</i> - Ibo Van de Poel & Lamb√®r Royakkers<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">We read section 1.6 of this book, which went into depths about how engineers are not the only ones responsible for consequences of a technology they developed. I liked how they assigned groups of people to vocabulary that made it easier to sort out an ethical issue. It defined actors, users, regulators, and stakeholders. It made the general overview of an ethical dilemma more navigatable, and I thought that specific section was valuable to understand.</p></li>
									<li><i>Design Capabilities</i> - Carissa Carter<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">Althought this article seemed to relate less to ethical issues than the other assigned readings, it still indirectly held value in the content we've been studying. I enjoyed the interpretation of the old "five hexagon" design strategies into the new Eight Capabilities they described. It was both interesting and a nice diverge from normal content.</p></li>
									<li><i>Best Laid Plans</i> - William A. Shermen<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">This novel by Shermen detailed how the unintended consequences from the human race have always been more dangerous and impactful than they ever thought possible by their creation. It also expands into how to avoid these massive ethical consequences, which is a vital part of information for this couse. We will more than likely face an ethical issue in our time in the workforce, so the more information we have on preventing or solving these issues the better.</p></li>
									<li><i>Why Do We Care So Much About Privacy?</i> - Louis Menand<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In one section this article spoke about the Cambridge Analytics issue with Facebook, with is definitely an ethical dilemma I think deserves a reaction. While first reading it my reaction was that it was very informative and also a modern text at the same time, bringing up very recent issues that most of us have probably heard about. It was a well-worded article that I think helped connect the old ethics cases to us students.</p></li>

								<h3>Messages from Class Meetings</h3>
								<ul style="text-align: left">
									<li><i>Lecture 1</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">The message from the very first ENEE200 class was that digital devices can actually propose a problem in the classroom when it comes to distracting you while taking notes and also distracting those in your vicinity. It made me think about my use in other classes, and if I should really be using it as much in my other classes because I would love to pass my first semester.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 2</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">One of the things that really stuck with my from this lesson was just how controversial some ethical dilemmas could be, specifically in our discussion of the case of Cody Wilson. He developed a 3D-printable gun, and it made me think intensely about where the line for what is ethical in technology and what is not is drawn. It made me reflect on how I should double think when programming, and making sure everything I'm implementing is politically and ethically correct.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 3</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">During this lecture we dove into the ethics of everyday objects, which was definitely a new perspective I had never used before. We explored how potentially normal objects in our life now (like my group's assignment was a refridgerator), could potentially have brought along or insighted ethical issues when it was develop. This made me think about other things in my daily life, like sinks and disposable water bottles that impact the environment to a whole new level.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 4</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In this lecture, we discussed what Codes of Conduct are and how they can be beneficial to a workplace. This was an intereting concept to me because it's almost like a set of moral rules to follow, and I think it does the job well for trying to minimize ethical dilemmas. I think they should be implemented anywhere necessary.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 5</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">Here was where the socialtechnical map was shown to us, and we practiced how to implement and draw them. We revisted the ideas of what corresponds to a "Good Engineer" and also delved into the micro-, meso-, and macrosocial elements of a sociotechnical system. This taught me how to break apart a company into the different parts that work and more importantly made me think about the idea of a business as a whole.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 6</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">Intended and unintended consequences, along with their similarities and differences, were discussed in Lecture 6. Something that really surprised me was the fact that female drivers are 47% more likely to be injured in a crash because the safety systems are specifically designed with a man's body in mind. This then can be applied to all engineered products, where you must consider every single user and use case that may be employed.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 7</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In Lecture 7, we had a guest lecture from Dr. David Tomblin, the director of STS. He made us reflect on the hopes and concerns of the development of autonomous vehicles, which caused me to think about all the upcoming self-driving technology and whether it would be a burden or benefit. Self-driving cars would require loads of new infracture to be built, and this could instead be put to helping the hungry or poor instead.</p></li>
									<li><i>Lecture 8</i>:<br/>
										<p style="margin-left: 2em">In this class, we went through possible solutions to prevent big unintended consequences, and we thought that treaties like the Geneva Convention could aid well. The section we learned on preventing disturbed equilibrium made me realize that you really do have to take into account every thing that could possibly go wrong in order to make a conscious ethical decision about the product.</p></li>

									<h2>Relevance to Myself</h2>
									<p>"Between 1997 and 2001, the author conducted an informal survey of Stanford undergraduate engineering students and the practicing engineers they contacted about two topics: the study of engineering-related ethical issues in undergraduate engineering education, and the presence of ethical issuues in engineering practice."</p>

								Over the period of time I've taken this course, I have definitely grown as an engineer and student. In regards to myself, I've learned that ethical issues are very important to me and I enjoy diving into them and learning more about what went wrong. With these cases and articles we've read, my perspective on the development of a project has changed. I learned that when creating something you need to be extra careful about who will use this and how they will use it, because you always want your product to be used in an ethically moral way. I could apply what we've learned in so many ways, especially in my development of iOS apps in my free time as a Computer Science major. When making apps, you always want to make sure they are accessible to everyone, regardless of handicap, and now I will also prevent any misuse of the apps I create.</p>
