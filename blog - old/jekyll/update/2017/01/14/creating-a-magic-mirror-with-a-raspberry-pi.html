    <p>Hi there! Recently I dove into one of my bigger projects, which involved creating a “magic” mirror with the help of a Raspberry Pi (a popular System-On-A-Chip, more details <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">here</a>).</p>

<p>Now blog’s aren’t exactly my thing, but I’m trying to get better. Seeing as how this may be awful, feel free to check out the guide that I followed <a href="http://cyber-omelette.blogspot.co.uk/2016/12/smart-mirror.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-and-after">Before and After:</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/367A3rx.jpg" alt="Before assembly" style="width: 49%" />
<img src="https://i.reddituploads.com/11033303ca494f58820ed03b0edf2ef2?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=0c842b1ce6a55b29890dd3c44f62b081" alt="Finished project picture" style="width: 49%" /></p>

<h3 id="materials">Materials:</h3>
<hr />
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monitor</strong>, I opted for a 22-inch Dell (~$100)</li>
  <li><strong>Picture frame</strong> that will fit the monitor (~$20, found at A.C. Moore)</li>
  <li><strong>Gila Privacy Window Film</strong> (~$30, can be found <a href="http://a.co/2uN11PE">here</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> (~$50, I purchased the kit <a href="http://a.co/70vupj2">here</a> because it comes with a case and power supply too. You will also need a SD card, if you don’t have one lying around I purchased <a href="http://a.co/eB4Cs5I">this</a> recently and it worked well)</li>
  <li><strong>Various other materials</strong> including: electrical tape, black posterboard, wood 2x4, wood screws, double-sided tape or glue, power strip</li>
  <li><strong>Various tools</strong> including: alternative computer to program Pi from, scissors, utilty knife, saw, tape measure, squeegee, spray bottle</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hardware-assembly">Hardware Assembly:</h3>
<hr />
<h4 id="part-1---the-glass">Part 1 - The glass</h4>
<p>First, I took the glass from the picture frame and applied the privacy film to it. Fill the spray bottle with a mixture of water and soap to create a cleaning mixture. Then spray and clean both sides of the glass, you don’t want any fingerprints showing through! Take the Gila film and use two pieces of tape to peel the protective layer off. Next, spray both the side of the film that was protected and the side of the glass you will apply it to. Once they’re decently moist, apply them together and use the squeegee to remove any air pockets. Finally, use the utility knife to trim the excess sides of film from around the glass! This may take a few tries of practice to get the film removed enough so it can fit back into the frame, but the privacy film comes in 15ft strips so you’ll have plenty of error room to work with. Once back in the frame, you have essentially a two-way!</p>

<h4 id="part-2---the-monitor">Part 2 - The monitor</h4>
<p>In this segment we will prepare everything for the monitor and place it where it needs to be. For this section, I’d recommend assembling everything with the frame face down, so the back of the glass is to you. First, remove the bezel from your monitor. It’s a whole mini-project in it’s own, but something every Magic Mirror-maker must go through. A good video guide can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOCC6qWIlA">here</a>. Once the bezel is removed place the monitor face down on the glass in the center. Fill in the left over space on the sides with trimmed black posterboard, and secure the posterboard to the frame or monitor with the black electrical tape.</p>

<h4 id="part-3---the-wood">Part 3 - The wood</h4>
<p>Once this is finished you must secure the monitor the the picture frame using the wood 2x4. This will vary for all projects based on how it will be mounted and the sizes of the frame and monitor. The general idea of what I did was to first cut two small beams about the width of the frame. I sawed a slit in the wood beams just enough to catch the end of the monitor frame, and when placed on the top and bottom of the frame the monitor would catch the slit and stay put. The wood beams must be nailed into the frame with the wood screws, pinning them monitor against the glass.</p>

<h3 id="wiring-and-software">Wiring and Software:</h3>
<hr />
<h4 id="part-1---the-connections">Part 1 - The connections</h4>
<p>Now here is where we must attach the Raspberry Pi to the back of the frame and run all the wire connections. I would recommend the use of <a href="http://a.co/iEuJswb">3M double-sided adhesive tape</a> to stick the Raspberry Pi to the frame and stick other wires in place, I live by this stuff and use it all over my room. Once the computer’s in place, wire up the Pi and monitor’s power to the power strip, running the power strip cord out of the frame. Then connect the HDMI cord of them monitor to the Pi’s HDMI output (I had to use a <a href="http://a.co/i7gLjvY">VGA to HDMI converter</a>). To help everything stay secured, zip-tie down the wires!</p>

<h4 id="part-2---the-software">Part 2 - The software</h4>
<p>First, you need to get a running version of Raspian (the Pi’s default OS) on the SD card. I’d recommend using <a href="http://www.pibakery.org">PiBakery</a> to customize your Raspbian like so:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Iy2C83k.png" alt="PiBakery setup" style="width: 200px" /></p>

<p>Then you should be able to log into your Pi right from the command line and get started. Try this with:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh pi@mirrorpi.local
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once logged your Pi, let’s get the Magic Mirror software up and running. We’ll first run the installer for the <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror">MagicMirror GitHub project</a> and then configure it.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/master/installers/raspberry.sh | bash
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There are many configuration options you can add to your setup. Let’s walk through a few of them (more can be found <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/Configuring-the-Raspberry-Pi">here</a>).</p>
<h5 id="rotate-the-screen-in-the-case-of-a-vertical-monitor-and-hide-the-rainbow-startup-cube">Rotate the screen (in the case of a vertical monitor) and hide the rainbow startup cube</h5>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then add the following lines to the bottom:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">display_rotate</span><span class="o">=</span>1
<span class="nv">avoid_warnings</span><span class="o">=</span>1 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And reboot</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo reboot
</code></pre>
</div>

<h5 id="auto-hiding-the-mouse-cursor">Auto-hiding the Mouse Cursor</h5>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install unclutter
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4 id="part-3---auto-starting-the-magic-mirror">Part 3 - Auto-starting the Magic Mirror</h4>
<p>Ideally, we want this Electron app to launch everytime we reboot the Pi, so let’s configure that with the PM2 production process manager for Node.JS applications. Adapted from <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/Auto-Starting-MagicMirror">the GitHub project</a>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo npm install -g pm2
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Load PM2 on boot (execute the command it tells you to after this is run)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>pm2 startup
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, let’s create a script for PM2 to start the mirror</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~
nano mm.sh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And enter in the file:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/MagicMirror
<span class="nv">DISPLAY</span><span class="o">=</span>:0 npm start
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then run <code class="highlighter-rouge">chmod</code> for executable access to the script and start the mirror</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>chmod +x mm.sh
pm2 start mm.sh
pm2 save
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="the-end">The End</h3>
